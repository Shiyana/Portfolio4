                This project showcases my application of unsupervised learning through K-Means clustering on a retail customer dataset, aiming to segment customers based on income and spending scores for targeted marketing. The class activity "Navigating Human Bias as a Leader in AI and Education" significantly shaped this work, emphasizing ethical leadership and fairness. Through a chatbot-guided exercise, we tackled three machine learning scenarios that mirrored real-world data challenges:
                <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                  <li><strong>Missing Data:</strong> We addressed incomplete health study data (e.g., missing age and weight) using imputation techniques like median and multiple imputation, reflecting on how missingness might skew results for underrepresented groups, a concern raised in Shiyana Jayanesan Shylaja’s discussion on diverse data audits.</li>
                  <li><strong>Noisy Data:</strong> We handled noisy sensor readings with smoothing techniques (e.g., moving averages, z-score filtering), considering how noise could obscure fair segmentation, aligning with the need for transparent metrics.</li>
                  <li><strong>Imbalanced Datasets:</strong> We explored SMOTE and class weighting for rare disease prediction, connecting to inclusive design principles discussed in class, ensuring models don’t overlook minority groups.</li>
                </ul>
                These scenarios, completed with detailed decision-making and Python implementations (e.g., SimpleImputer, SMOTE), enhanced my technical and ethical skills. Diagrams will illustrate the clustering process, data preprocessing, and segment distributions.

                This project deepened my understanding of data preprocessing and ethical AI leadership, shaped by the "Navigating Human Bias" class. I learned to handle missing data with imputation, clean noise with smoothing techniques, and address imbalance with resampling, skills honed through the chatbot scenarios. In real life, I apply these by advocating for transparent data practices in my team projects, ensuring fairness in model outputs—e.g., checking for underrepresented groups in datasets during my daily work. My objectives were to master clustering and align it with ethical principles, which I achieved by integrating class insights like Shiyana’s strategies (e.g., feedback loops). The information gathered from scenarios (e.g., Python code, metric choices) guided my process, while results showed four distinct customer segments with improved fairness. Feedback from the chatbot encouraged deeper exploration (e.g., MNAR handling, threshold tuning), which I incorporated by documenting decisions thoroughly. This work, customized for a professional audience, reflects my growth in AI/ML and leadership.
